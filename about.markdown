<h3> My Personal Blog  </h3>

My name is ZebadiJah Maxwell and I am currently a second year student at the Dominica State College. I
am 18 years old and I am majoring in Information Technology and Computer Science.
<br/>
<br/> When I began college I did not know that there was a research institute on campus. However I learnt of
the Create building via orientation. At that time, I did not pay much mind to the institute and prepared
to begin my studies. I went through three major changes in my first semester. I began as a French and
Information Technology major. However, there weren’t enough students majoring in the foreign
language, so it became unavailable. Upon hearing this, I registered to become an English and
Information Technology major. This was also unavailable, so I attempted to switch to Business; however,
the outcome was the same. In frustration, I applied for Biology. I stayed a Biology and Information
Technology major for three days before I learnt that there was computer science available. I reflected
and came to the conclusion that I loved learning about technology and computers and wished to major
in Information Technology and Computer Science. I applied and successfully got through. I finished my
first semester rather smoothly and moved onto my second semester. I always believed that performing
well in school should be one’s first priority when conducting their studies. With this belief and
determination to excel, I pursued excellence. To my surprise, this excellence was recognized by my
lecturers who recommended me as a potential recruit for the Create Caribbean Research Institute
internship program.
<br/>
<br/>Prior to receiving an email to become an intern, I had long forgotten that the research institute existed. I
was shocked but excited. Initially, after reading the email and attending the meetings and interview, I
thought that this was an opportunity to learn more about technology and extend my research skills.
However, since from joining the internship, I have learned that there is a lot to Create Caribbbean.
Create Caribbean is a Research Institute at the Dominica State College. This research institute empowers
students to bridge gaps in digital literacy and cultural fluency. The institute seeks to preserve and
disseminate Caribbean culture and heritage. I have learnt that Create Caribbean internship program
utilizes majors such as mine; Information Technology and Computer Science, in collaboration with
others to develop tools and codes that help to foster a culture of intellectual inquiry, encourage the use
of digital technology and perform projects that discover deeper research on Caribbean culture. So far, as
an intern, we have been learning more about digital humanities and creating blog posts to reflect our
reading process. My journey with the Create team, lecturer and fellow interns has been very informative
and fun and I truly wish to continue on this path that Create has provided.
