The Kingdom of this World written by Alejo Carpentier in 1949 is a historical novel that documents the first successful slave revolution in the Americas. The setting of the novel was that of Hispaniola between 1791 and 1804, which is now modernly Haiti and Dominican Republic. The Kingdom of this World is told largely from a point of view of a poor, uneducated slave named Ti Noël. This novel is greatly considered as Alejo Carpentier’s first great novel as it displays amazingly vivid tableaux that captures both the complexities of the European colonialism in the New World and the confusion of political upheavals.</p>

Breath, Eyes, Memory by Edwidge Danticat follows the main character of 12 year old Sophie
Caco who is sent from her impoverished village of Croix-des-Rosets to New York, to be reunited
with a mother she barely remembers. From there she discovers secrets that no child should ever
know, and a legacy of shame that can be healed only when she returns to Haiti--to the women
who first reared her. Breath, Eyes, Memory is necessary for my project as it contains the historical event - The Duvalier dynasty and the upheaval of this dictatorial dynasty. Breath, Eyes, Memory documents contains trauma, political upheaval, Haitian folklore, spirituality, turmoil, bloodshed and the life-warping experience of moving from the Caribbean to the USA. </p>

The Haitian Trilogy (Henri Christophe; Drums and Colours; The Haitian Earth): written in 2002 by Derek Walcott is a drama type book that contains three history plays. The three historical plays are Henri Christophe, Drums and Colours and The Haytian Earth. The author; according to the publisher “uses verse to tell the story of his native West Indies as a four-hundred-year cycle of war, conquest and rebellion.” In the plays of Henri Christophe and The Haytian Earth, the author re-casts the legacy of Haiti’s violent revolutionaries which were led by leaders like Toussaint L’Ouverture, Jean Jacques Dessalines and Henri Christophe, whose rebellions established the first black state in the Americas but whose cruelty becomes a parable of racial pride and corruption.</p>
