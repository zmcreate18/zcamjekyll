Over the week, in HIS115, we have revisited many tools and terms along with project preparations. From Week 5, February 8, we revisited text encoding, discussed and refreshed our memory with topic modelling and reviewed Voyant. Text Encoding refers to unfamiliar expressions like punctuation being intermixed with the familiar flow of the natural language writing system. Topic Modeling is a form of text mining. It is a way of identifying patterns in a corpus. Voyant is a digital humanity tool that is web-based and is utilized for text reading and an analysis environment. Voyant is a scholarly project that is designed to facilitate reading and interpretive practices for digital humanities and scholars as well as for the general public. In revisiting Voyant, we examined texts and explored the features and availabilities that Voyant provides. It was very fun to analyze the texts and change the features to produce a different word or model.

In addition, to revisiting tools and digital humanity terms, we also focused on our individual projects. For the Individual Project, we were to write a five hundred word proposal of our individual digital humanities project that we will submit as part of the larger Visualizing Caribbean Literature project. We were to submit our proposal while following the guidelines presented such as thinking of a specific set of theme, genre, pattern, author, and relationship that you will like to pursue. We were also to utilize no more than three tools as part of the guidelines. I was very excited about this individual project and brainstormed for a long time about what I would like to focus on. For my Individual Project, I am doing a Historical Treasure Hunt focusing on Haiti. I am also going to be utilizing tools such as Twine.

Lastly, we have also been working on the Visualizing Caribbean Literature spreadsheet and data cleaning it. Though it is taking some time, the spreadsheet is slowly but surely becoming clean.
