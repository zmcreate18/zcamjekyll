When we began working on our projects from November 16th, we were required to log our intern hours and post progress reports. This meant that the blog posts on the course readings had come to an end from Week 10. When I began working on the project and was presented with a task requiring the research of Caribbean books, I was excited. My task was to search for Caribbean Literary books and save them in the folder 2001-2010. The interns were introduced to the websites World Cat and Internet Archive, which were virtual library catalogs that could help one search for any literary work, by our lecturer. These websites were given as a way to aid in finding the books required to complete our task. In addition, we were also given other tools that may help us, including Google and our lecturerâ€™s own collection of literary works.

My fellow interns and I learnt Digital History which is an approach to examining and representing the past that works with new technologies. There are many definitions of digital history including the one mentioned before and such as a methodology framed by the hyper textual power of these technologies. It was fun to learn about Digital History. I was also made aware of how the creation of new media tools can aid in resolving historical problems. In addition, in searching for the necessary works, I became overly excited and distracted as I wanted to read every research work I came across. I explored and analyzed the advanced search buttons of World Cat and Internet Archive, and in doing so, found ways to locate the necessary books faster and easier. These books I had immense fun in reading the summaries and adding them.

Unfortunately, due to being swamped with work from other courses as it was nearing the end of the semester, I became stressed, forgot to log my hours and lost my excitement. However, every time, I had class for Digital Humanities, my excitement was rekindled, especially when we began to learn about Wax, Jekyll, Github and how to install Wax and Jekyll.
