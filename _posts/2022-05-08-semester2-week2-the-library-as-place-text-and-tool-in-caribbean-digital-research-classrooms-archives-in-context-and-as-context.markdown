<p>In Topography, Topology, Typography: The Library as Place, Text and Tool in Caribbean Digital Research Classrooms by Dr Schuyler K Espirit, she begins by sharing her how her move to Dominica and research interests that were focused on reading practices, reception and the communities created by and through various forms of literary encounters in the Caribbean led to understanding the critical need for academic libraries and archives in the smaller islands of the Eastern Caribbean. She further went on to share that the <i>“Create Caribbean was established on the Dominica State College Campus to elevate the place of research in the college’s agenda, to engage students in service learning and innovative experiences with technology, and to pave the way for different research possibilities at the institution.”</i> – Dr Schuyler K Espirit.</p>

<p>Through the introduction of the digital humanities as a course at the college, she faced many hardships in demystifying the concept of digital humanities such as trying to convince policy makers, educators and artists that digital humanities was indeed a significant field of study that would help to shape the direction in which Caribbean Education and cultural practice headed especially because the idea that the term seemed to methodological and was not academically popular prevented the easy accessibility and availability of libraries. The entire success of the Research Institute depended on the acceptance and success of digital humanities becoming popular and encouraging students to focus on their history and heritage while creating essential connections with the national libraries and archives. Through hard work, she has managed to make digital humanities a successive course resulting in the reminder to students that heritage and history about their homelands is vital to their academic and professional success and also later served as a hopeful sign that the preservation and growth of the libraries and archives will serve to build the country through decreasing brain drain and also be a model for the region. <i>“I hope that my experiences in building a platform for the digital humanities will resonate with other scholar-teachers and result in both popularity and diversity of digital humanities pedagogy and praxis in the region, with the focus in building up rather than setting aside the fortresses of knowledge that are the region’s libraries and archives.”</i> – Dr Schuyler K Espirit.</p>

<p>In Archives in Context and as Context by Kate Theimer, she speaks on how archives have different meanings as context and in context and how using the term archives to refer to things which archivists would not call archives, has become a custom. According to Kate Theimer (2012) <i>“It is not the adoption of the term by digital humanists that is noteworthy, but that its meaning in certain contexts has been altered by scholars, many of whom have experience working with archives as traditionally defined. And yet it is these scholars who have chosen to describe the collections they have created as archives, seemingly in all sincerity that their usage is appropriate and not in contradiction to the practice of archivists.”</i> Archives seemingly have many different definitions presented by different people or organizations though the common definition is a place in which valuable materials are collected. To Kate Theimer, her concern is that in the broadening of the word archives, there is a potential loss of understanding and appreciation of the historical context that archives preserve in their collections. She hopes that the usage of the word archives can be with an understanding of the principals, and an appreciation for the role of archives in the way that archivists manage it.</p>
