<p>In addition to the cleaning of the data on the Spreadsheet, classes for HIS 115 taught by Dr Esprit, recommenced. From the week of January 17, we had readings on Schuyler Esprit, Library as Text, Place and Tool and Kate Theimer, Archives in Context and as Context. The first reading stated was a portfolio created by Dr Schuyler Esprit on Topography, Topology, Typography: The Library as Place, Text and Tool in Caribbean Digital Research Classrooms. This reading was very interesting and will be utilized later on when the tool Hypothes.is is introduced. As for the second reading, Kate Theimer, discusses about archives in context and as context and the need for greater communication between digital humanists and information professionals such as archivists about the areas where their practices intersect.</p>

<p>Next, from January 25th, we learnt about the Use of Archives, Primary Sources and Secondary Sources, How to read, write, show/tell and about the tools Hypothes.is and Twine. Hypothes.is is a free, neutral, open software that works everywhere on the web as a conversation layer. Hypothes.is utilizes annotation to enable sentence level note taking or critique on top of classroom reading, news, blogs, scientific articles, books, terms of service, ballot initiatives, legislation and more. For Hypothes.is, we first created an account then installed the extension of Hypothes.is to our preferred browser. After, we were able to start annotating on any page. I did my first annotation on the reading Schuyler Esprit, Library as Text, Place and Tool: Topography, Topology, Typography: The Library as Place, Text and Tool in Caribbean Digital Research Classrooms. It was very fun for all of us to annotate text and reply to each otherâ€™s annotation.</p>

<p>Twine is a free open source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories. Originally created by Chris Klimas in 2009, Twine has been used to create hundreds of work. Presently, Twine is now maintained by a bunch of persons at many different repositories. Stories can be created with variables, conditional logic, images, CSS and JavaScript. It publishes directly to HTML so the work can be posted anywhere. Twine can be used and downloaded for Windows, MacOS and Linux.  I love the idea of Twine and I am excited to create stories in the future especially for the individual project that will become a larger part of the big project.</p>
