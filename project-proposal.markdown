The Final Project requires all the course participants to work on the project, Visualizing Caribbean Literature. However, each student is required to do an individual digital humanities project that should be submitted as part of the larger Visualizing Caribbean Literature project. 
<br>
<br/>This work is a Project Proposal of the individual work that I wish to complete and submit. For my Individual Project, I propose that I explore the theme of historical events in Haiti. In other words, I would like to focus on navigating the historical events of Haiti through the use of five to ten literary works, all written by Caribbean or Haitian authors. In navigating the pattern and theme of historical events that took place, I would also like to look at the sub themes of tragedy, politics, and religious culture. 
<br>
<br/>In addition, I have formulated two research questions that I would like to explore and answer through the Digital Humanities methods and tools. Firstly, I would like to explore and answer the question: What impact did the historical event have on the protagonist and citizens of Haiti?  Secondly, how did the historical events mentioned in the books influence the current affairs and state of Haiti? I wish to explore the first research question as the protagonist of the story, is either based on a real person or represents the people of Haiti. This means that I would ultimately be looking at the realistic impact on Haitians through characters. For the second research question, the basis of this is that I am looking at the effects of the historical events on Haiti’s present political and or economical affairs. 
<br>
<br/>In brainstorming my individual project, I recalled the work of Breath, Eyes, Memory by Edwidge Danticat when I was doing spreadsheet data cleaning. I had loved the novel and enjoyed deciphering the messages and meanings portrayed in her book. She depicted the realism of Haiti through the eyes of a character and it was phenomenal in understanding Haiti along with this character's growth. Using Breath, Eyes, Memory as an inspiration, I decided to look at Haiti and the historical events that took place but through the use of literary works. I also want to feature how Haiti’s freedom/independence came at a price which they are still paying today. That way, others can understand the country and its people more in depth. 
<br>
<br/>All in all, I would like to do a Historical Treasure Hunt: Navigating the historical events of Haiti through the use of six. For this story mapping, I have decided to utilize the Digital Humanities tools of VisualEyes, which is an HTML5 web-based authoring tool that can weave images, maps, charts, video and data into a highly interactive and compelling dynamic visualization.
